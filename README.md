##Purspose
To analyze trends and patterns of the results of math and reading score, school funding of various schools, Maria, Chief Data Scientist of a school district, wants us to help her in analyzing all standardized test score for math and reading of  15 different schools in that district so that she can prepare a report regarding school budget based on overall math ,reading and passing score. She should be able to analyze top and bottom five schools by school size, type of school and different grades performances.
 
###Explain the purpose of this analysis.
This analysis was done by using Anaconda and Jupyter notebook with the help of Python Programming language. We got clean complete data by removing missing grades and analyzing school summary based on different groups. Maria had found some dishonesty in 9th grade score in Thomas High School, so for this project, she wants us to replace the math and reading score by Nan(not a number) for Thomas High School and keeping other scores same for other schools. We need to analyze again the district school reports by different groups and compare the data with previous one to get an overall analysis.

 #Results :
How is the district summary affected?
There was no big change in district summary, except the overall passing score changed a little.
